## What is?

With MoreGameRules, you can edit some settings that vanilla game doesn't allow you to do, or just simplifying the process. 

Some examples are removing Hunger, making all items unbreakable or removing Farmland Trampling (When you trample on Wheat for example it won't change to dirt).

### Editing Game Rules
You can edit the Game Rules in the "config.yml" on plugin folder, everything is self-explain, but if you need more help don't exite in asking.
